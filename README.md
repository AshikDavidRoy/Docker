# Docker
This lesson plan will guide you through Docker step by step, starting with the fundamentals and advancing toward container security, deployment, and CI/CD integration. Based on your roadmap​(docker), we'll cover each concept in a structured and hands-on manner, ensuring you're ready for real-world Docker usage.

---

### **1. Introduction to Docker and Containers**
**Objective:** Understand the purpose and benefits of containers.

- **What are Containers?**  
   - Containers encapsulate applications and their dependencies in a portable, isolated environment.
   - Compare containers with VMs and bare-metal setups.
   - **Why do we need Containers?**  
     - Portability, consistent environments, and lightweight resource usage.
   - **Difference between Bare Metal, VMs, and Containers:**  
     - Explore key concepts like isolation (using Namespaces, cgroups) and union filesystems.
  
- **Hands-on:**  
  Research common use cases for Docker and write down how containers solve specific problems in modern software development.

---

### **2. Setting Up Docker**
**Objective:** Install Docker and ensure basic Linux understanding.

- **Installing Docker:**
   - **Windows & Mac:** Docker Desktop.
   - **Linux:** Docker Engine.
   - Refer to the official [Docker Installation Guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) for each OS.
  
- **Linux Fundamentals (prerequisite for Docker):**  
   - **Package Managers:** Use apt/yum for installation.
   - **Users/Groups & Permissions:** Understand sudo, file permissions (chmod, chown), and their relevance to Docker.
   - **Basic Shell Commands:**  
     - Navigation, file operations (ls, cd, mv, rm), and scripting.
   - **Shell Scripting:** Learn to write simple scripts, which are useful in automating Docker tasks.
  
- **Hands-on:**  
  After installation, run basic shell commands and create a shell script that prints "Hello Docker!"

---

### **3. Getting Started with Docker**
**Objective:** Understand and run basic Docker commands.

- **Running Your First Container:**
   - `docker run hello-world` (Verify installation)
   - Explore `docker ps`, `docker images`, `docker stop`, `docker rm`.

- **Docker CLI Basics:**  
   - Working with **Images** (pulling from DockerHub)  
   - Managing **Containers** (running, stopping, restarting)  
   - **Volumes and Networks**
  
- **Hands-on:**  
  Run an Ubuntu container, connect to it using `docker exec`, and try installing some packages inside it.

---

### **4. Dockerfiles and Building Images**
**Objective:** Learn to define and build container images.

- **Dockerfile Basics:**  
   - Writing a simple Dockerfile.
   - Key instructions: `FROM`, `RUN`, `COPY`, `CMD`.
  
- **Efficient Layer Caching:**  
   - How Docker builds images in layers, and tips to optimize build times.
   - Reducing image size and improving security.

- **Hands-on:**  
  Create a Dockerfile for a Node.js application, build the image, and run it as a container.

---

### **5. Working with Container Registries**
**Objective:** Store and share Docker images.

- **DockerHub:**  
   - Push and pull images.
   - Best practices for image tagging.
  
- **Other Registries:**  
   - Explore alternatives like GitHub Container Registry (ghcr), AWS ECR, and Google Container Registry (GCR).
  
- **Hands-on:**  
  Push your custom-built image from the previous lesson to DockerHub.

---

### **6. Managing Containers with Docker Compose**
**Objective:** Run multi-container Docker applications.

- **Docker Compose Basics:**  
   - Define services using `docker-compose.yml`.
   - Running applications with multiple services (web, db, etc.).
  
- **Hands-on:**  
  Create a `docker-compose.yml` file for a multi-tier web application (e.g., a Node.js app with a MongoDB backend).

---

### **7. Data Persistence in Docker**
**Objective:** Understand how to persist data in containers.

- **Ephemeral Filesystem:**  
   - Containers are stateless by default.  
   - **Volume Mounts** and **Bind Mounts:** For persistent storage.
  
- **Hands-on:**  
  Create and run a container with volumes to store data that persists after the container is stopped.

---

### **8. Container Security**
**Objective:** Secure Docker images and containers.

- **Image Security:**  
   - Scan images for vulnerabilities using tools like Docker's Security Scanning
- **Runtime Security:**  
   - Restrict container capabilities (using user namespaces, SELinux).
   - Use Docker’s built-in security mechanisms like AppArmor.

- **Hands-on:**  
  Use Docker security features to harden a container running a web application.

---

### **9. Continuous Integration with Docker**
**Objective:** Integrate Docker in CI/CD pipelines.

- **Using Docker in CI/CD:**  
   - Running containers for tests in GitHub Actions or Jenkins.
   - Building and deploying images automatically.
  
- **Hands-on:**  
  Create a simple GitHub Actions workflow that runs tests inside a Docker container.

---

### **10. Deploying Containers at Scale**
**Objective:** Learn to deploy containers using orchestration tools.

- **Kubernetes Overview:**  
   - Basics of Pods, Services, and Deployments.
   - Docker Swarm and other alternatives (e.g., HashiCorp Nomad).
  
- **PaaS Solutions:**  
   - Overview of cloud PaaS options for deploying containers.
  
- **Hands-on:**  
  Deploy a simple application to a Kubernetes cluster (use Minikube or a managed solution like GKE).
